        <h2><ins>Description: What is Seviyan (Sheer Khurma)?</ins></h2>
        <p>Seviyan or Sheer Khurma (vermicelli pudding) is a widespread Eid-ul-Fitr tradition for South Asians. The word ‘seviyan‘ itself refers to the South Asian-style vermicelli pasta used to make all types of desserts. Seviyan
        can be prepared dry (Sukhi Seviyan) or with milk (Doodh Seviyan/Seviyan Kheer or Sheer Khurma). In context, when I say Seviyan, I mean a milk-based toasted vermicelli pudding.</p>

        <h2><ins>Notes on the Ingredients</ins></h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pakistani or Indian vermicelli (Seviyan)</strong>: To make this recipe, you need South Asian vermicelli used specifically for making Seviyan/Sheer Khurma. It’s finer than other vermicelli pastas. A few brands I’m familiar with are Ahmed Foods, National, and Shan. They’re often labeled as ‘Roasted Vermicelli’, but we’ll be toasting them anyway.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Whole milk</strong>: I didn’t get a chance to test dairy-free options, but I think coconut milk would play well with the flavors.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Heavy whipping milk</strong>: Heavy whipping cream, or Double Cream for those in the UK, is the magic ingredient that makes it possible to make a quick Sheer Khurma. Without cream, you’d have to spend time reducing down the milk to give it some depth. I’ve given the quantity of 1 1/4 cup, but you can play with this to see what your ideal creamy ratio is. Try 1 cup if you want it lighter (or don’t want to use more than an 8 oz box of heavy whipping cream), or up to 1 1/2 cup if you’d like it even
            richer.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Butter, ghee, or oil</strong>: I’ve used just enough to coat the seviyan while toasting it. If using ghee, note that it may rise to the top of the Sheer Khurma.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Green cardamom pods</strong>: I prefer not to bite into cardamom seeds in my seviyan, which is why I’ve used a good amount of the pods to give it flavor and scent. I break a few open to extract the flavor.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sugar or sweetner of choice</strong>: The amount of sugar I’ve added is the amount you’ll need if you use 1 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. If you use an
            extra 1/4 cup, increase sugar to taste.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Blanched, silvered almonds</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Rose water or Kewra water</strong>: Both are diluted extracts that add a beautiful aroma to the finished dish. Each brand varies in strength, so adjust to
            taste.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2><ins>Time to Make the Seviyan (Sheer Khurma)</ins></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil milk</strong>: First, heat milk and heavy whipping cream in a nonstick saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. (Don’t worry– the milk will not stick as long as you’re using a nonstick pan.)</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Toast Seviyan</strong>: Next, toast the vermicelli along with the cardamom pods for about 5 minutes. The color should change significantly, without burning it of course.</li>
                <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong>: Add the toasted vermicelli to the simmering milk along with the sugar and any optional add-ins.</li>
                <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Boil together</strong>: Raise the heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir constantly for 5-6 minutes, until it starts to thicken. You’re simultaneously cooking the seviyan while reducing down the milk. The important thing here is to stop boiling when it’s runnier than you prefer. Once you turn off the heat, some vermicelli will rise to the top and stay there.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Garnish</strong>: Lastly, garnish with nuts and rose or kewra water.</li>

        <h2><ins>More Sheer Khurma Add-Ins</ins></h2>
        <p>I’ve kept it simple and kid-friendly, but Sheer Khurma can be as elaborate as you’d like. Here are some add-ins you’ll find across regions. Most of them (except saffron) are typically soaked, then toasted with ghee before being added to the boiling milk.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Golden Raisins</li>
            <li>More slivered almonds, chopped pistachios, or other chopped nuts (often referred to as dry fruit)</li>
            <li>Coconut flakes</li>
            <li>Chironji/Charoli (melon seeds)</li>
            <li>Saffron - add a pinch toward the end</li>
        </ul>
