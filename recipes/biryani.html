        <h2><ins>Description: What is Biryani?</ins></h2>
        <p>Biryani is an intricate <ins>rice dish</ins> made with layers of curried meat and rice. Given its use of adornments and luxurious finishes, it is no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine.</p>
        
        <p>There are two main methods of making biryani:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Kachi</em> <strong>(raw) biryani</strong>, made with raw meat and parboiled rice and cooked together, and</li>
            <li><em>Pakki</em> <strong>(cooked) biryani</strong>, in  which cooked meat and parboiled rice are steamed together.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In Pakistan, <em>pakki</em> (or cooked) biryani is most common, with several prominent varieties such as Sindhi, Karachi-style, and Bombay biryani. This recipe is an amalgamation of these styles and is similar to what you would find at a typical Pakistani or Indian restaurant or dinner party.
        </p>

        <h2><ins>Notes on the Ingredients for Chicken Biryani</ins></h2>
            <img src="https://www.teaforturmeric.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chicken-Biryani-Ingredients-Labelled.jpg" alt="image of spices and marinated chicken in a bowl on a white table">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil/Ghee</strong>: I’ve used oil for fluidity and ghee for taste.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Onions</strong>: You can either thinly slice them (more traditional) or finely chop. If using a food processor to do this, pulse to chop so that it doesn’t blend into a paste.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bone-in, cut up, skinless chicken</strong>: I buy pre-cut up pieces of a whole chicken, but bone-in chicken thighs work too. You can also use boneless chicken, though it may require a shorter cooking time.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Whole spices</strong>: A generous amount of whole spices are a distinct characteristic of biryani. Whole spices are meant to be discarded while eating, but if you don’t want to bite into them, feel free place them in a spice/muslin bag.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Garlic + Ginger</strong>: I’ve given their quantities in whole form and tablespoons. I use a mortar and pestle or a food processor to crush them.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Since biryani has lots of sour ingredients like yogurt, dried plums (alu Bukhara), and lemon, I’ve found keeping the
            tomatoes to a minimum gives it just the right amount of tang.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Yogurt</strong>: Not only does a yogurt marinade make the chicken more tender and flavorful, but it also makes cooking the biryani much smoother. For a dairy-free option, try using coconut milk.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Rice</strong>: I suggest using aged, long-grain basmati rice you can find at some grocery stores, any Indian/Pakistani specialty store, or online.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Dried Plums (Alu Bukhara)</strong>: I always cherish the helping of biryani with these sweet surprises. Alu Bukhara are often used in biryani to give a sweet, tangy taste. They’re usually available at South Asian grocery stores, but if you can’t find them, you can either substitute with dried prunes or omit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><ins>Chicken Biryani in 3 Simple Steps</ins></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the chicken curry.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Parboil the rice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring it all together for a final steam (‘dum‘).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><ins>Step 1. Prepare the Chicken Curry: Biryani Masala</ins></h2>
        <p>Pakistani biryani is heavy on spice (and flavor!), and is often made with biryani masala, or simply put, a medley of spices that come together to give it a distinct, masaledar (or spice-laden) taste.</p>
        <p>I recommend you use the biryani masala recipe below (all you need is a good spice grinder and a few extra whole spices). If you’d prefer not to, you can substitute your favorite store-bought biryani masala.</p>
        <p><strong>To make biryani masala at home</strong>, combine the following ingredients in a spice grinder and process until mostly smooth. Makes ~2 tbsp, which is the exact quantity you’ll need for this recipe.
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium dried bay leaf (tez patta)</li>
            <li>2 dried button red chili peppers (sukhi lal mirch)</li>
            <li>1 small whole mace (javetri)</li>
            <li>1 2-inch cinnamon stick (daarchini)</li>
            <li>4-5 whole cloves (loung)</li>
            <li>1 black cardamom (badi elaichi)</li>
            <li>1 star anise (baadiyan)</li>
            <li>3-4 green cardomom pods (elaichi)</li>
            <li>1 tsp roasted cumin seeds or black cumin seeds (shahzeera)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black peppercorns (kaali mirch)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp fennel (saunf)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
        </ul>
        </p> 
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><ins>Step 2. How to Make the Chicken Tender and Flavorful</ins></h2>
            <img src="https://www.teaforturmeric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chicken-Biryani-8.jpg" alt="a pot of marinated chicken curry and a wooden ladle">
        <p>There are 3 components that make the chicken tender and deeply flavored:
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt. This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor. Ideally, marinate overnight or for at least a couple hours, but I tested and found that it’s still very tasty if you marinate just before making the biryani.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing the biryani. Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps it cook more evenly and stay tender.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Lastly, after sautéing the chicken in the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently, covered, over low heat.</li>
        </ol>
        </p> 
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><ins>Step 3. How to Parboil the Rice to Ensure Fluffy Rice in Biryani</ins></h2>
            <img src="https://www.teaforturmeric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chicken-Biryani-7.jpg" alt="a strainer filled with white rice">
        <p>Identifying doneness can be confusing, so I’ve simplified it by giving time parameters to take the guesswork out of
        boiling.</p>
        <p>If you’re using the recommended aged, long-grain basmati rice, you’ll need to boil for 5 minutes. If you’re using newly harvested basmati rice often found in American grocery stores, it’ll require a shorter boiling time (around 4 minutes).</p>
        <p><strong>For reference, here’s how my rice acts minute-to-minute:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>At 3 minutes, the rice still has a raw center.</li>
            <li>At 4 minutes, the center has mostly cooked, but the rice kernel is still tough.</li>
            <li>Around 5 minutes, the rice starts to swell and the rice is just-cooked. In between 5 minutes and 5:30 seconds is when
            it’s ideal to stop boiling the rice.</li>
            <li>At 6 minutes, the rice is cooked, but starts to break easily without getting mushy.</li>
            <li>In between 7-8 minutes, the rice gets mushy once pressed between your fingers. This is a sign that it’s overcooked and
            is more likely to break during the ‘dum’ stage.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Drain the rice promptly so the hot water doesn't continue cooking the rice.</p>
        <p>Also note that a little overcooked or undercooked rice is not going to ruin your biryani.</p>

        <h2><ins>Putting it Together</ins></h2>
            <img src="https://www.teaforturmeric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chicken-Biryani-10.jpg" alt="four images showing white rice mixing with marinated cooked chicken curry and spices to complete the biryani recipe">
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the ingredients listed under ‘marinade’. Cover and set aside or refrigerate
            (ideally) up to overnight. When ready to use, allow the chicken to come to room temperature.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Thoroughly wash the rice and soak it in water. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pan over high heat. Add the oil, ghee, and onions and sauté until the onions are golden (~15-20 minutes). Deglaze the pan with ¼ cup water. Once the water dries up, add the whole spices, garlic, and ginger and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the chicken with its marinade and sauté until it changes color (~2-3 minutes). Add the tomatoes, green chili pepper, and dried plum (alu bukhara) and stir to coat. Add ½ cup water (the water should cover about 1/3 of the chicken) and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer (this is low heat on my stovetop), cover, and allow the chicken to cook for 30 minutes, stirring midway. While the chicken is cooking, proceed to the next step. Turn off the heat once the chicken has cooked.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Place a medium pot over high heat and bring 7 cups (1.75 quarts) of water to a boil (See Tip). Add salt, oil, and lemon juice/vinegar and stir. Once the water comes to a boil, drain and add the rice. Stir, and bring it back up to a boil. Once it comes to a boil again, boil for 5 minutes (no more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds), or until the rice is just cooked with a bite to it. It shouldn’t get mushy when pressed between your fingers. (See Note1) Drain and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Uncover the chicken. Raise the heat to medium-high to sauté out any excess water for 2-3 minutes. Add salt, garam
            masala, and red chili flakes for more heat (if desired). The oil will have separated from the ‘masala’. Turn off the
            heat. Add kewra water and lemon juice and stir to combine.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Steaming ('Dum')</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>If needed, lightly oil the bottom of a dutch oven or stock/soup pot. Layer half of the drained rice. Sprinkle 1/4 tsp of the chaat/garam masala on top of the rice. Add in all the chicken, and top with the remaining rice. Sprinkle the
            remaining 1/4 tsp of chaat/garam masala. Drizzle in the colored milk and oil. (Optional: Sprinkle a pinch of food
            coloring directly for more variation in color.) Sprinkle the cilantro leaves and mint leaves, and arrange the lemon
            slices on top.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If your pan isn’t heavy bottomed, place a heat diffuser, flat griddle, or tava underneath the pan to diffuse the heat.
            Layer the lid with a kitchen cloth (or aluminum foil) and seal tightly. (See Note 2) Turn on the heat to medium and
            allow the biryani to develop steam for 4-5 minutes. You’ll be able to feel the steam starting to escape the sides. Then
            turn down to the lowest heat and allow it to cook in its steam (‘dum’) for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the
            biryani to rest with the lid on for 10 minutes. Do not stir or mix. To serve, gently move on to platter with rice paddle
            or small plate. Serve hot with yogurt or raita.</li>
        </ol>
