        <h2><ins>Description: What is Masala Chai?</ins></h2>
        <p>Masala chai (or Spiced Chai) is a traditional Indian tea made with spices, ginger, and milk. Though Masala Chai isnâ€™t as popular in Pakistani culture as it is in Indian culture, growing up as a South Asian in America, Iâ€™ve had countless
        cups. Masala chai elevates a regular cup of chai with spices, making it even more relaxing, calming, and soothing to the
        senses.</p>
    
    <br>
        <h4>Special Note: <em>Chai vs Masala Chai</em></h4>
        <p>The word chai simply means tea. You have the simple, milky cup of chai, the characteristically pink Kashmiri chai, and many other popular versions of chai. Masala Chai is distinguished by the use of spices, or masala, in chai.</p>

        <h2><ins>Ingredients for Masala Chai</ins></h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whole Spices</strong>: This recipe uses 4 whole spices that are commonly used to make Masala Chai.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon sticks (both Cassia & Ceylon work here)</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Cloves</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Green cardamom pods</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Black peppercorns</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Fennel seeds</strong>: Optional, but I love how they make masala chai more vibrant. Some restaurants also use mint leaves which gives a similar, fresh flavor.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Fresh ginger root</strong>: If Iâ€™m feeling under the weather, Iâ€™ll add another slice or 2 of ginger. Otherwise, I prefer the ginger to be subtle. For stronger ginger flavor, use a mortar & pestle to crush it instead of slicing.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Feel free to use whole milk, reduced-fat milk, lactose-free milk, etc. For a dairy-free substitute, Iâ€™ve tried soymilk, which takes well to boiling.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Though a regular cup of chai is fine unsweetened, I find sweetener is critical to drawing out and balancing the spices of Masala Chai. I love using the less-processed turbinado (similar to demerara sugar) and adding it while making the chai. This way, it dissolves into the chai instead of settling down to the bottom of your cup. You can substitute with any sweetener of choice. If using honey or maple syrup, add it once youâ€™ve taken it off the heat.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2><ins>Getting the Masala Chai Ready</ins></h2>
        <p>Here's how to make the perfect cup:</p>

        <ol> 
            <li>Place a saucepan over high heat and add water. If youâ€™re using a larger pan, add an extra 1/4 cup water to account for the extra evaporation. Add the whole spices & ginger while the water is coming to a boil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Throw in the tea bags (or leaves) and reduce the heat to a simmer so the tea and spices have time to infuse the water. Stop and smell the aroma of the spices here.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the milk and sugar. Once it comes to a boil, lower the heat and allow it to simmer for another 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Raise the heat to high and allow it to come to rolling boil for a minute or so, depending on how â€˜cookedâ€™ you like the milk. There is no right or wrong, it simply boils down to ðŸ˜‰ preference.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour into cups through a strainer and discard tea bags & spices.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <br>
    
        <h2><ins>How to Aerate Chai</ins></h2>
        <p>In Pakistan and India, Chai vendors (called chai walah) use a ladle to repeatedly scoop up and pour back the chai. I find this enhances the taste and creaminess. Often, theyâ€™ll expertly pour the chai from a distance into small cups, creating natural, frothy bubbles.</p>
        <p>Upon trying it, I noticed the more narrow the glass, the more frothy it gets (similar to how you need a narrow Turkish Ibrik to create froth on Turkish Coffee). Since most of us donâ€™t have the hand-eye coordination of tea vendors, we can use a milk frother to create a similar effect.</p>

        <h2><ins>Tips for the Perfect Cup</ins></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The type of tea you use is extremely important to the overall flavor. I usually use Tapal tea, but this may be more because weâ€™re used to it than for its quality.<li>
            <br>
            <li>If the color is not deep enough or the chai is not strong enough after youâ€™ve allowed the milk to simmer for a few minutes, feel free to add more tea bags/tea leaves.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Lastly, like with any drink, youâ€™ll discover your ideal cup over time. Even while (gladly) testing this recipe many times, my preferences evolved and fluctuated.</li>
        </ul>
